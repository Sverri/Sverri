### Hi, I am Sverri ([`/ˈsvɛɹːɪ/`](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Sverri))

- Software engineer with many years of experience with web development and related tooling
- Worked on large web-based Total Agency Management System involving many business domains and technologies

I got into web layout/design at the age of 12 using Internet Explorer 4 and the ever-reliable Notepad. Thinking back is a bitter-sweet affair of layout tables, spacer GIFs and days upon days studying source code, articles and W3C documentation to figure out how simple things, like rounded corners or multi-column layouts, could be achieved.

These days I work mostly with Typescript, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, NPM, C#, MSSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Git and Github. For personal projects I have been getting more and more into libraries/frameworks like React, Redux, Svelte, Sapper, etc.

You can contact me at sverrimo at gmail dot com.
